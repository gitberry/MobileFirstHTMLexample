                The hollow just in front of you is called a "kettle". Look
                around, and you will notice similar features in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over 10,000 years ago, as the glaciers slowly melted, large
                chunks of ice broke off and gradually became covered
                by glacial till released from the melting ice. With warming
                temperatures, these giant ice cubes eventually melted and
                the material covering them sank - leaving depressions in the
                landscape - like the one you see before you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You won't find any water in this kettle.The soils that have
                developed here 
                <img src="illustration.png" class="illustration44" style="float: right; margin-right: 18px; padding: 2px;">
                are well-drained
                and support a forest community.
                However, the next time you take a drive in
                the countryside, observe the circular shape of
                many of our ponds
                and sloughs. Most of these originated as glacial kettles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a closer look and notice how the plant communities
                differ, depending on which side of the kettle they are growing
                on. Which slopes get more sun? Which get more shade?
            </p>
            <p>
                Just a short distance ahead is another stop - one that will
                challenge your ability to focus on small details.
