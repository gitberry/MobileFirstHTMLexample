                Take the 'One Step Challenge'. Staying on the trail, take
                one GIANT step forward and make a note of the distance
                between your left and right footsteps. Now, examine the
                surface on either side of the trail along this distance. See if
                you can count at least 10 different kinds of plants. You might
                have to get down on your knees and poke your nose through
                the greenery. Surprising how much variety you can uncover
                <img src="illustration.png" class="illustration44" style="float: right; margin-right: 18px; padding: 2px;">
                in the space of a single 
                footstep!
            </p>
            <p>
                You might even find a pale plant of medium
                height, covered with red or purplish spots.This
                is the spotted coralroot - an orchid species. This
                plant has no chlorophyll. It is saprophytic, which
                means it obtains its
                nutrients from dead
                organic matter through
                a cooperative - or symbiotic - relationship with a fungus.

                As you continue, look for the characteristic white trunk of
                the trembling aspen emerging in the distance. A mixedwood
                forest of poplars and spruce lies ahead.
