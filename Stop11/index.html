                The familiar pines once more surround you.  You have just 
                explored four unique ecosystems. Can you remember and
                name them?

                Nature reminds us that we too are part of the cycle of life.
                Consider the Impacts of our day-to-day lives on the natural 
                systems that sustain us. Perched on the brink of global climate 
                change, the kind of future for us,and for all life on this planet, 
                is uncertain. Make one personal commitment today to lessen 
                your impact on our natural environment.
