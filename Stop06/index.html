                Most of the grayish-green clumps of plant-like material
                that you see at your feet or the "stringy stuff" hanging
                from the tree trunks and branches lives on air.

                Lichens are complex relationships between fungi and algae.
                Algae produces carbohydrates through photosynthesis, while
                fungi provide protection and obtains moisture and nutrients
                from the air.

                lichens are some of the over 500 species of lichens that occur in the boreal
                forest. Green reindeer lichen (Cladina mitis) and the Northern reindeer lichen (Cladina stellaris) form
                much of the ground cover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gently touch some of the lichens at your feet. They may feel
                either brittle, if the weather has been dry, or springy, if there
                has been recent precipitation. Lichens act as sponges, taking
                up everything that comes their way, including air pollution.
                For this reason, lichens serve as indicators of air quality.
            </p>

                As you continue your walk, take note of the variety of
                lichens that you encounter - on the ground, on trees and on
                logs.

                At your next stop you will find a kettle - but don't expect
                hot water for tea!
