                Touch the "soaking math quote of organic soil that reaches deeper
                Then the height of the house. Over the time, the accumulation
                of partially decomposed vegetation in this former streambed

                saturated peat. These black spruce trees, with their

                Run your hand over the carpet of feather mosses. In spring, sun-colored marsh
                marigolds brighten this backdrop. Look for the tall white

                plants amidst horsetails, grasses and sedges.

                Leaving the boardwalk, you will again be encircled by
                the familiar pines. Listen carefully for a faint "tapping" of a
                foraging downy or hairy woodpecker.
