                This part of the forest is home to many wildlife species like white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, and
                red-backed vole.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dense shrubs provide food or browse for deer in the winter. Take a close look at the ends of twigs
                and see if you
                can find ONE that has

                not been chewed on. Look for the reddish bark of the red-osier dogwood, their
                preferred browse.

                The boreal mixedwood forest is also one of the richest environments
                for breeding songbirds in North America. Over 250 bird species, most of them migrants,
                have been recorded in the boreal ecosystems. It is the
                abundance of protein-rich 'bugs' which makes this forest so
                attractive for them.

                Your final stop is just ahead.
