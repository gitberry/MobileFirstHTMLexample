            <p>Jack pine is the most common type of tree that you will
                encounter on this trail. Probe the ground with your fingers
                and feel the sandy soil beneath the shallow layer of duff.
                These soils are poorly developed and subject to water and
                wind erosion.The deep tap roots of these trees must reach
                down to capture nutrients, as well as to provide stability.</p>
            <p>Touch the"tweezer-like"twinned needles of the pine. Feel
                the thick bark that protects these trees from ground fires. Find
                a pine cone and notice the tough resin that holds the scales
                closed. Only heat - or a squirrel's teeth - will release the seeds
                within. In fact, 
                <img src="illustration.png" class="illustration44" style="float: right; padding: 2px;">
                it was a previous fire that gave birth to this forest.</p>
            <p>Glance up at the tangled nest of small
                branches - aptly named "witches broom" - a reaction caused by a tiny
                parasitic plant, dwarf mistletoe, which has infected these trees.
                Dwarf mistletoe catapults its sticky seeds as far as 20 meters
                onto the branches of adjacent trees. Infected trees weaken
                over time and may eventually die.</p>
            <p>As you continue to follow the trail, listen for the chatter of
                red squirrels and look for patches of dry ground cranberry
                and bearberry on the forest floor. A "wall of spruce" will signal
                your arrival at the next stop.</p>
