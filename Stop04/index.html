                At the top of this rise, a new world opens before you. Kristi
                Lake is a complex of shallow open and marsh that
                sustains a variety of wetland wildlife and vegetation.

                The official name of this water body is actually Coubeaux
                Lake - after noted naturalist Eugene Coubeaux who hailed
                from Belgium and spent some time in central Saskatchewan
                towards the turn of the previous century.

                The Ducks Unlimited Canada signs located here will explain
                the importance of water and wetlands, like Kristi Lake.
                The next section of the trail parallels the northern shoreline
                of Kristi Lake. Take the time to look and listen for birds and
                other animals that call this "forest oasis" home.
