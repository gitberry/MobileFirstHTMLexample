                You are now in a forest dominated by trembling aspen,
                with some balsam poplar and white spruce.
            </p><p>                
                Why 'mixedwood'? The boreal forest is comprised of a 
                mixture of hardwoods (trembling aspen, balsam poplar,
                white birch) and softwoods (black and white spruce, balsam
                fir, tamarack and jack pine). Which trees grow where is 
                <img src="illustrationB.png" class="illustration44" style="float: right; margin-right: 18px; padding: 2px;">
                determined by differences in soil, moisture conditions,
                and the type and frequency of natural and human-caused 
                disturbances (fire, logging, insect infestations, disease). The 
                boreal forest is a mosaic of various-sized patches of forest
                differing in age and composition.

                Poke your finger into the soil. You may notice soils here
                have less sand and more clay and the depth of the forest litter
                 - dead material - is much greater than in the jack pine forest.
                Decomposing forest litter feeds a more lush understory of 
                shrubs and herbaceous plants.
            </p><p>                                
                Compare the two poplar species. Can you see the deep dark 
                <img src="illustration.png" class="illustration44" style="float: right; margin-right: 18px; padding: 2px;">
                furrows along the trunk of the balsam poplar? The trembling
                aspen with the greenish-white, smooth trunk is located here 
                as well. Can you see it? The trunk of the trembling 
                aspen has a white powder that will rub off on
                your hand; it is believed by some to act as a sunscreen for the tree.

                As you walk to your next stop, watch for signs of animal activity.
