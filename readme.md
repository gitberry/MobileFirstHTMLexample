Mobile first study - #1
=======================

First in a (hopefully) continuing series of "study" projects - this one is what I'd call "plain HTML"

basic HTML & CSS - minimal JS
-----------------------------

Nothing super special (*) in this markup - minimal javascript and all following conventional folders. 

Example
-------
The real-world example of it is here:
<https://northberry.ca/kristi>  A nice little Nature Trail I've had the pleasure of visiting.


(*) exception
-------------
I have a link to allow minimal statistics
