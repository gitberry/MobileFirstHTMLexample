                Early in spring, listen for the chorus of "Frog courtship".
                Later in the spring, watch as the next generation of
                Canada geese leaves the nest. Birdsongs fill the crisp morning
                air, clouds of adult

                caddisflies emerge
                from their aquatic
                nursery, a muskrat slices through the
                water... there is
                always something new.

                The strip of land between your feet and the water's edge is the
                riparian area - a vital link between water and land. Riparian
                zones reduce erosion, funnel nutrients to aquatic ecosystems,
                and provide wildlife habitat and travel corridors. Can you see
                any animal tracks leading to and from the lake?

                Notice the arrangement of the vegetation surrounding the
                open water. Cattails and rushes occupy the wettest places;
                next to them willows and alders, and some tamarack. Then
                where it is drier, the trembling aspen and white spruce appear.

                At the next stop you will encounter one of nature's enigmas
                - an organism that is a relationship.
